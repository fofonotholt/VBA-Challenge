# VBA-Challenge
Bootcamp Module 2 Challege, VBA Green Stocks Analysis.
### VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
We started the analysis to find a green stock to invest in. We start with data of 12 different green enegry companies. Our Main goal is to Analyse the data of the 12 companies for 2017 and 2018 and give Advice to the user and their client. Our approach is to create a macro, to analyze the data more efficiently and give the user a data-driven. We will Use a VBA code to analyze the excell data, create a macro, and get the results needed to get to the best conclusion possible.

## Results
### 2017
In 2017 we have mainly possitve returns. We can see the lowest positive return is "RUN" with a 5.5% yearly return. Return in 2017 were as high as 199.4%, which is something very attractive to any investor. We can see we have 4 tickers with returns over 100% (DQ with 199.4%, ENPH with 129.5%, FSLR with 101.3% and SEDG with 184.5%), and only one with negative returns (TERP with a -7.2%). Overall if we invesed equally in the entire portfolio we would've had a 67.3% ROI (Return On Investment). In the chart bellow we can observe the table with the results.

### 2018
2018 is a year in which we can observe mainly negative returns. Out of the 12 companies, only 2 had positive returns (ENPH with an 81.9% and RUN with an 84%). The rest where negative returns, ranging from -62.5% to -3.5%. the best performig stock was "RUN" and the lowest performing stock was "DQ". If we invested equally in the entire portfolio we would've had a negative ROI of -8.5% in 2018. In the table bellow we can see the returns for 2018.

### Comparison & Conclusion
As we can see we had mainly skyrocket retuns in 2017 and a small sunk in 2018 returns. We can see that "DQ" was the best performing stock in 2017, however it was the worst performing in 2018. Also "ENPH" had great returns in 2017 and was the second best performing stock in 2018, from the data given, we can see that it would be a great investment option, with big and consistent results. "RUN" can also be seen as a good option, it had positive returns in the 2017 and was the best performing stock of 2018. Based on the data we analyzed i would recomend to invest in "RUN" and "ENPH", and not investing in "TERP" (which had negative retuns both years).

## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- Pro: We can have a simpler and more efficient code.
- Pro: We can reduce the computing time so the code can run faster.
- Con: It can be very time consuming.
- Con: Refactoring a code can be stressful, since we try to improve something that's already working. Finding a new solution can be stressful and unnecessary.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
- The main advantage of refactoring the code, was that since the code was more direct while going through the data, it ran a lot faster.
- The main disadvantage is that it took me more time to refactor the code that to write the original one.
